                        <p>We use the existing PDF format for our team to develop the drawings in Revit and CAD, which the pdf makes more accessible and better design development. The design development phase is important in the construction process. All we need is a PDF of the project drawings and the highly skilled team of our engineers with us who can take your pdf data and turn it into a very detailed BIM model using Revit and CAD.</p>
                        <p>We also specialize in providing 3D models from your pdf for interior and exterior as per our clients requirements. You can choose from our full range of Revit and CAD architectural services for your interior and exterior design.</p>
                        <p>We trust our clients to provide accurate Revit architecture services with maximum satisfaction through its unique services, technical expertise, low cost, timeliness of project execution and high quality standards.</p>
                        <h3>AutoCAD to Revit Model</h3>
                        <p>All we need is a 2D CAD file (.dwg) of the project drawing and our BIM modelers can convert it to BIM model using Revit. We can convert all types of drawings, including architectural CAD drawings, structural CAD drawings and MEP CAD drawings to BIM models using Autodesk Revit. Our BIM experts will first understand exactly which building components the client wants in the model, and at what level of detail (LOD) each element should have. Our BIM modelers take your actual dimensions and design intent from reference source files provided by clients and create information-rich collaborative BIM models for downstream processes.</p>
                        <p>Our BIM modelers can deliver efficient and accurate BIM models in accordance with building construction codes, standards and specifications. We trust our clients to provide accurate Revit architecture services with maximum satisfaction through its unique services, technical expertise, low cost, timeliness of project execution and high quality standards.</p>                        
                        <h3>Hand Survey to Revit and CAD Model</h3>
                        <p>We use the existing survey format for our team to develop the drawings into Revit and CAD, which the survey makes more accessible and better design development. The design development phase is important in the construction process. All we need is a project survey file of the project drawings and our BIM modelers can convert it to a BIM model in Revit and CAD. With our dedicated team we can produce high quality models for existing houses.</p>
                        <p>Our skilled designers will perform measured building surveys to produce the existing building models using Revit and CAD. These measurements are then transformed into a set of existing drawings. Depending on the type of development you are doing, these may include floor plans, elevations, sections, site plan roof plan and 3D views, all required by our designers and your local planning authority. The existing drawings and measurements recorded in your survey will then be checked to ensure that everything is of the highest standard and ready for development in the future - whether for planning or your building regulations.</p>
                        <h3>Proposed Drawings</h3>
                        <p>Our skilled designers work closely with you to produce a Revit and CAD model using your preliminary architectural drawings that bring out the best for your project.
